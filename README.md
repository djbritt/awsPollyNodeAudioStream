## AWS Polly Node - Express - Socket.io Audio Stream Response :speech_balloon:

Make sure you have set your credentials in ~/.aws/credentials styled like so.
And make sure the key and secret have the right AWS polly permissions associated to them.

```[default]
aws_access_key_id = KEYHERE
aws_secret_access_key = KEYHERE
```

Otherwise, clone this repo, type

```js
npm install
```

Then I like to use nodemon server.js, but you can also use node server.js to run the server.
